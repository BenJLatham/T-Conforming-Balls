**T-Conf** is a Python library for constructing symmetric, transfinite-conforming meshes using [Gmsh](https://gmsh.info/) for geometries involving concentric **disks** (2D) and **spheres** (3D).

This project was developed for use in FEM methods, where symmetry and structured layering near interfaces are critical for capturing resonance behavior in sign-changin problems.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install locally in editable mode:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/T-Conforming-Balls.git
cd T-Conforming-Balls
pip install -e .[dev]
````

Make sure Gmsh and its Python API are available in your environment:

```bash
pip install gmsh
```

---

## Usage

You can use the CLI tool to generate meshes directly:

### Disk Example

```bash
tconf disk --a 0.1 --rInner 0.5 --rOuter 1.0 --out my_disk.msh
```

### Sphere Example

```bash
tconf sphere --a 0.2 --rInner 0.8 --rOuter 1.5 --out my_sphere.msh
```

These will generate `.msh` files you can open in Gmsh or use in downstream solvers.

To preview the mesh visually:

```python
import gmsh
gmsh.open("my_disk.msh")
gmsh.fltk.run()
```
